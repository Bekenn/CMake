cpack-deb-package-description-fallback
--------------------------------------

* The :module:`CPackDeb` module learned new package description
  override rules to match :module:`CPackRPM` module behavior.
  **Breaking change**: If :variable:`CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE`
  variable is set to non default location then it is prefered to
  :variable:`CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY` variable.
  Also a new :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION`
  was introduced for component based packaging.
  See :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION`.
